    "Our goal is wanted  recreate the profile, login, and sign up features in Java, as well as update the backend admin screens for the running spring server.\n",

    "Github ID of Student (Is their ID valid? How much have they committed? Are they consistent? Do they have issues and pull requests?)\n",

    "2) **Github ID of Student**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Password**\n",
    "   - **Type:** Private String\n",

    "4) **Classes Student Enrolled In (CTE Compsci Pathway)**\n",
    "   - **Type:** Private Array or ArrayLIst? of Strings \n",
    "   - **Description:** Lists the classes the student is enrolled in, specifically within the CTE Compsci Pathway. The attribute will be an array where each element is a string representing a class name or ID. This is where we use and join two databases—a user database and a section database—creating a relationship between users and sections. \n",
    "     - You might not need multiple databases in your project. A simple nested arrays approach can be used when dealing with a small number of users. For example, in a previous project, an exercise attribute stored information (such as duration and timing) in a small array. Each form entry (a small array) was combined into one large array for all entries. However, for managing many students in CSA, CSP, and CSSE, multiple databases are necessary to handle the relationship between users and sections effectively.\n",

    "5) **KASM Server**\n",

    "     - (Yes → True, No → False)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "6) **Profile Picture (pfp)**\n",
    "   - **Type:** Private Base64 String\n",

    "- **Validate Input:** Ensure each attribute meets the expected format and constraints, such as validating the GitHub ID and securing passwords.\n",
    "- **Store Data Appropriately:** Use correct data types and formats, like hashing passwords and using Base64 encoding for images.\n",
    "- **Handle Arrays:** Manage attributes like \"Classes Student Enrolled In\" as arrays to allow flexible enrollment and updates.\n",
    "- **Boolean Logic:** Use boolean values for attributes like \"KASM Server\" to manage feature access or permissions.\n"
